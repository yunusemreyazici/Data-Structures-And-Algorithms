- in our lesson we learned what is a singly linked list.
- We learned that a singly linked list is a data structure which actually stores collection of data.
- It contains sequence of nodes, so here you can see that there are four nodes
- having data 10,1,8 and 11
- and you can also see the first node is being referred to by the head
- We also learned that node is having two properties one is the data property and one is the reference to the next node in the list.
- Let's see a demo of how to create a singly linked list having the data as 10,1,8 and 11.
